Getting Started
===============

1. Install [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html)
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the local repository directory (e.g. `cd ~/git/`)
3. Clone this repository to `git clone git@github.com:sam-caldwell/react-native-boilerplate.git`
4. Navigate to the repository (`cd react-native-boilerplate`).
4. Execute `make setup` to install all prerequisites for the supported environments.
5. The `make setup` will create the full platform (react-native client and golang server).
6. The `make clean_setup` will nuke the environment and allow you to start over.
